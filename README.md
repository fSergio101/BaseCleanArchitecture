# BaseCleanArchitecture
This first real project that I develop by myself try to be the base clean architecture for future projects. At the same time It will grow up including UI changes with new Android Design Library. Another interesting ideas I have are: using dagger 2 instead of dagger or change the Bus Implementation, giving a try to AutoBus By BQ.
